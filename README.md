# Gamesforfree_clone_project

This project is a recreation of the popular gaming website FreetoGame. The project will include features such as user login and registration, search and sorting capabilities, the ability to add games to a personal library, as well as the ability for users to leave a review and a rating for each game, allowing for a more interactive and engaging experience. Additionally, the project incorporates extra features not present in the original FreetoGame website, such as pagination for browsing large collections of games and generating random user profile pictures upon login. <br>
