# Gamesforfree Clone Project

This project is a recreation of the popular gaming website FreetoGame. The project includes features such as user login and registration, search and sorting capabilities, the ability to add games to a personal library, and the option for users to leave a review and rating for each game. This allows for a more interactive and engaging experience. Additionally, the project incorporates extra features not present in the original FreetoGame website, such as pagination for browsing large collections of games and generating random user profile pictures upon login. The game data is sourced from the FreetoGame API, and the random profile pictures are sourced from the Pexels API.
